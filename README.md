Background:   
In India, the prevalence of stunting and anemia have declined in the last decade but continue to remain high in many regions, whereas those of overweight and obesity have increased in all age and socioeconomic groups. Whether these forms of malnutrition cluster is important for development of appropriate interventions.  

Objective:   
Our objective was to describe the prevalence of a comprehensive list of dual burdens of malnutrition in individuals and households across the 36 States and 640 districts of India.  

Design:   
We analyzed data from the National Family Health Survey-4, 2015-16, including 655,156 women age 15-49 years and 145,653 children aged 6-59 months in India. We measured the co-existence of 19 combinations of women’s anemia, underweight and overweight and children’s stunting, underweight, overweight and anemia at individual and household levels. We aggregated this information to the State (n=36) and district (n=640) levels. We examined whether the observed dual burden prevalence exceeded the expected prevalence, and whether any such excess was related to household wealth.  

Results:   
Among the 19 dual burdens examined, 8 had significant excess prevalence at the State level while 5 had significant excess prevalence at the district level. All but one of these instances reflected an excess dual burden of undernutrition as opposed to clustering of overweight with a form of undernutrition. Household wealth was not positively associated with any clustering of burdens.   

Conclusions:   
While dual burdens of anemia, stunting and underweight are prevalent, there is not yet evidence of clustering of overweight with other forms of malnutrition in India.
